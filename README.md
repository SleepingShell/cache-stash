# Cache Stash
The goal of this project is to make a simple, single-node caching solution. The performance on this probably isn't that good, I just needed a quick caching solution for some of my other projects.

The **Cacher** interface provides a generic interface so more than one caching solution can be provided (i.e different eviction rules, optimized searching etc)
